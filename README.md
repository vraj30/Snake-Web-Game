# Snake-Web-Game
This Snake Game is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic snake game, this project allows players to control a snake to consume food, grow in size, and avoid collisions with itself and the walls. The game offers a simple yet engaging experience, suitable for users of all ages.
## Features

- **Dynamic Snake Growth**: The snake grows longer with each piece of food consumed, increasing the game's difficulty and requiring more precise control.
